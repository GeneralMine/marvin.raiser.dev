# My personal website

## Future Ideas
### Projects
Add a section about my projects with a small image gallery and an indiviudal page for every project.

### Talks & Publications
A section about talks I gave especially the IEEE Summer School one. Depending on the amount of talks I can fit in there I might combine it with my publications at Fraunhofer and TUM.

### Changelog
I want to implement a changelog styled timeline of important steps in my life. I'm still collecting all the steps and experimenting with it, so it may take a while.

The timeline will be fliterable by specific categories like CV (focus on business related stuff), hobby, education, volunteering etc.

Some categories might be hidden or blocked by a password to share private milestones as well.


## Developing

Once you've cloned the repo and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the site:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
