	<h2>Liability for contents</h2>
	<p>
		As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 paragraph 1 TMG under the general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not
		obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific
		infringement. Upon becoming aware of corresponding violations of the law, we will remove this content immediately.
	</p>

	<h2>Liability for links</h2>
	<p>
		Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we can also not assume any liability for these external contents. The respective
		provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents
		were not recognizable at the time of linking.
	</p>
	<p>
		A permanent control of the content of the linked pages, however, is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such
		links immediately.
	</p>
